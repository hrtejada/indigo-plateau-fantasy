Resources for different aspects of the site

### UI Libraries
Take a look through some Svelte UI libraries. They are helpful since they have a good amount of typical components already built and styled.
- [Svelte Material UI](https://sveltematerialui.com/)
- IBM based [Carbon Components](https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/)
- [Smelte](https://smeltejs.com/)
- [Sveltestrap](https://sveltestrap.js.org/?path=/story/components--get-started)

Or any other library you might find.

Or if you want to go nightmare mode and create our own components from scratch lol


### Colors/Themes
First one I really like is [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).
This site helps you generate complementary colors easily.

Next one is more for getting values but does give a decent amount of info - [Color-Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/). 
It shows all the color codes for whatever color you enter, which is helpful for keeping the color consistent across different browsers and screens. Also it gives a bunch of examples towards the bottom of a colors page which is helpful sometimes

### Icons
If there is going to be a lot of icons, it's hard to beat [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) really lol

### Fonts
I've only used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Tons of fonts and it helps you narrow down your choice

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
